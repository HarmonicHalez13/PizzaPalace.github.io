	<p>My name is Vincent Ramano and I am the owner of Pizza Palace. My family left Sicily when I was young,
	but that didn't stop my ma and pa from showing me the traditional ways of creating Italian food. I moved to 
	Los Angeles from Brooklyn at the age of 20. I knew immediately that I wanted to show others the experience of authentic
	Italian food. With the help of my wife, we opened The Pizza Palace and now I have another generation taking over after me!
	Our family-owned restauraunt is sure to bring smiles to all who come and enjoy our cuisine!
	<br> <br>
	We only specialize in Italy's finest pizza pies! We have special made brick stove ovens for the best Italian pizza in LA!</p>
